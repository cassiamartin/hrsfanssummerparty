# This is a YAML file, the syntax of which should be pretty self-explanatory.  (See the Wikipedia
# page if you need more help. The thing that gets me most often is missing the '-' before a new
# entry.)

# In general things are identified to the system only by their id numbers. This means that if you
# want to change the name of something, or how much it costs, you can do so without causing
# confusion.  (Changing costs will update all outstanding balances automatically.)

# If you want to add a new entry, it should get a new id number; however, that number need not be
# consecutive or in order. (The system uses the ordering in this file.)

# If you want to delete an entry, the system will gracefully delete all associated reservations.
# You might want to look at whether any such reservations exist first, though.

independent_room_fee: 10
reservations_enabled: true

# Note: the code currently assumes that "nights" should be "days" minus the last day.  If you have
# some kind of non-continuous party, we'll have to fix this (and I'll be sad).

# By convention I'm separating the ids for the different houses by 1000, and the ids for different
# rooms by 10.  This is just to make it harder to accidentally reuse an id.

# To indicate that a room is unavailable for a given night, leave out the corresponding room cost.
